                Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents 
                designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies 
                such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
                presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. 
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the 
                ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, 
                and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based 
                object-orientation, and first-class functions.
